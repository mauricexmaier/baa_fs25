This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","aliases":["CVE-2024-29041"],"modified":"2024-03-25T22:24:57Z","published":"2024-03-25T19:40:26Z","related":["CGA-5389-98xc-vr78","CGA-qg2p-wmx3-mx9q","CGA-rjrm-49wc-v48x","CGA-w26h-h47r-f6rx","CVE-2024-29041"],"database_specific":{"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-25T19:40:26Z","github_reviewed":true,"severity":"MODERATE","cwe_ids":["CWE-1286","CWE-601"],"nvd_published_at":"2024-03-25T21:15:46Z"},"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29041"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express"}],"affected":[{"package":{"name":"express","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/express"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"express","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/express"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"5.0.0-beta.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc.json"}}],"schema_version":"1.6.0","severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}]}
